        <span>
            Creasetoph.com is the brain child of myself (Chris Albert) and has been in the making for a few years now.
            The site started out with me just poking around with PHP and JavaScript trying to get some sort of site up. But now
            after a few years of experience and hard work creasetoph.com has had a huge make over. After working every day with PHP
            and JavaScript i developed some ways of my own to deal with everything, so instead of using some PHP framework or jQuery
            I wrote my own MVC PHP framework and animation JavaScript library. The only thing used in my JS library is Sizzle for element selection.
            My JS framework has its own inheritance scheme, animation library and ajax navigation. When you browse around creasetoph.com the outer frame of the page
            and navigation never gets refreshed. When you click a button, your request gets ajaxed to the server and it sends you back just the data you need, be that
            content, images, or audio. And if havent noticed yet the back button still work normally, which usually does not in most ajax sites. So i hope you can all
            enjoy the hard work i have done and have fun with the site.
